# Predicting California Fire Size with Linear Regression

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to make predictions of the size of California Wild Fires using a linear regression model. The data contains various features of past fires in order to produce more accurate predictions. The Data is processed and cleaned (ensuring missing values are handled), then the model's performance is evaluated using R-squared, MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE.
